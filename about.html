                            Teach that success comes in different packages, and know that failure is sometimes a stepping stone to personal and professional success. 
                            Also, bringing in professionals from various fields, study sessions, road trips to financial institutions, helping young men learn the importance of teaching business plans, having business savvy, and showing our youth that a higher power is the foundation on which we build on.</p>
                        <p>We want to invite young men who possess the desire to understand that success is more than achieving goals.  That wealth is always a work in progress and having it separates those that talk about it from those that are about it. Agility in this context means being physically fit is a direct correlation to a strong mind, and having the mindset that “Game On” is– to understand that life is about choices and   bringing your ‘A’ Game is a must to stand above the rest.</p>
